## **1. The Age of Shallow Intelligence**

Every week, there’s a new model. A new benchmark. A new *“state of the art”*. And yet, somewhere in this endless scroll of innovation, I’ve started feeling… disconnected.

When I began studying Data Science five years ago, I used to **fall in love with datasets**.
I’d spend hours plotting histograms, discovering patterns, finding meaning in missing values.
Each column had a story. Each distribution, a hint of something human.
I often told my juniors and peers who were new to data science that *data is the most important thing*. Start with the data. Start with the problem statement and the right question. Many times, the answer lies there - in the patterns; rather than in a model.

But lately, my own workflow has changed, and not always for the better. I realized I was spending more time **prompting and tuning models** than **understanding data**. More time *scaling experiments* than *asking questions.* Somewhere, the relationship changed. I was no longer *dating the data* - I was just swiping right on the next big model, the next LLM.

And it’s not just me. In a world where AI systems can code, summarize research, and even reason - it’s easier than ever to skip the fundamentals. The temptation to move fast and rely on abstraction is immense. But that speed often costs us the very *depth* that made this field magical in the first place.

## **2. The Moment I Realized I Was “Dating the Models, Not the Data”**

The realization came quietly. During one of my OCR projects, I caught myself optimizing prompts and latency for hours without once opening the actual dataset. It hit me ... I didn’t even know how the OCR text *looked* before passing it to the model. The human layer... the messy, unstructured, beautifully imperfect data was invisible to me.

That night, I opened one of the reports manually. And it felt strangely nostalgic, like revisiting a forgotten friend. There was richness, noise, quirks... all the things that make data *real*.

In another project, I hadn’t looked closely at the dataset because I wasn’t familiar with the domain. When I finally decided to deep dive, I found a glaring **data leakage**... something that could have completely invalidated my results. Presenting that model as-is would have been embarrassing. A simple *word cloud* and a quick *Google search* saved me from catastrophe. That day, I learned that sometimes the biggest breakthroughs come not from bigger models, but from simply **looking at your data**.

That’s when I knew what I wanted to do next: **go back to dating the data.** To slow down and rediscover the depth I was losing in the rush for abstraction.

## **3. Why “DatingTheData”?**

The name is half-metaphor, half-mindset. “Dating” implies attention, curiosity, and patience.
* It’s not about rushing to conclusions; it’s about learning to observe.
* It’s about caring enough to explore, question, and listen... to the numbers, the errors, the unexpected correlations.

That’s what I want to bring back into my practice: **intentional curiosity**.

> Because data isn’t just input; it’s a mirror of human behavior, biases, and decisions.
> And understanding it deeply is an act of respect.

So *DatingTheData* isn’t an anti-LLM manifesto. It’s a personal commitment: to balance **scale with substance**, **speed with sensitivity**, and **automation with awareness**.

## **4. Depth vs Scale**

The field of AI today celebrates *scale*: more data, more parameters, more compute.
But **depth** is a different dimension altogether.

* Depth is when you can explain why a model behaves a certain way.
* Depth is when you visualize distributions and draw insights.
* Depth is when you realize that a single data leak can flip an entire conclusion.
* Depth is about the number of questions you dare to ask.

And sometimes, depth means saying *no* to adding another model layer... and instead, going back to understand your data better. It’s about being able to pinpoint, interpret, and humanize models.

## **5. A Closing Note**

*DatingTheData* is not just a technical blog; it’s a **thinking space** for modern data scientists AKA the AI engineers of today. It’s a place for me to write, reflect, and maybe help others slow down too. So this blog isn’t only for those who build models; it’s for those who *think* about them.

If you’ve ever felt the burnout of building too fast, or the quiet guilt of not knowing your data enough ... welcome! You’re in the right place. Let’s rediscover the craft of depth, one dataset at a time.

> Let's make curiosity cool again ... because in a world obsessed with scaling up, maybe the real flex is slowing down.

In the next post, I’ll show what I really mean by *depth* in data projects — and how the answers change when you change the depth of your investigation.
