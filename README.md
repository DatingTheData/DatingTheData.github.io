> **Rediscovering Depth in the Age of LLMs**

Welcome to **DatingTheData** — a personal blog and thought space by Jinav Gala, dedicated to slowing down, rediscovering fundamentals, and rebuilding curiosity in a world obsessed with large models and fast results.

## Philosophy

"Everyone is swiping right on the Model. No one is listening to the Data.
In an age of shallow intelligence, Dating The Data is a vow to slow down. To look past the hallucination and find the human truth frozen in the numbers."

This site is my resistance against "Shallow Intelligence." Here, I refuse to automate my curiosity and instead focus on intentional observation, asking better questions, and finding meaning in the messiness of real data.

## About Me

I am **Jinav Gala** — GenAI Developer at CitiusTech, former Research Analyst Intern at Amazon, and lifelong observer. I believe data is just frozen human behavior, and understanding it deeply is an act of respect.
