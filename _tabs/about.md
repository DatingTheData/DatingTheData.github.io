## Hi, I'm Jinav.

By day, I am a **GenAI Developer** based in Mumbai. I build systems that can read, write, and reason.

But at my core, I am a **Translator**.

I’ve always stood at the intersection of two worlds: the rigid logic of code and the messy complexity of being human. For a long time, I tried to keep them separate. I thought "Data Science" was just about math.

But after years of building models, I realized something: **Data is just frozen human behavior.**

### Why I write this blog
I started *DatingTheData* to document my journey back to the fundamentals. This is where I dissect complex technical concepts, not just to understand *how* they work, but *why* they matter.
