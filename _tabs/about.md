## **The Translator**

I am **Jinav Gala**.

By code, I am a **GenAI Developer** at **CitiusTech**. I build systems that can read, write, and reason.
Previously, I explored the data behind global commerce as a Research Analyst Intern at **Amazon**.

By nature, I am an **Observer**.
I’ve always stood at the intersection of rigid logic and messy humanity. For a long time, I tried to keep them separate.
But after years of building models, I realized: **Data is just frozen human behavior.**

### **The Mission**
*Dating The Data* is my resistance against "Shallow Intelligence."
- It is where I slow down. 
- It is where I refuse to automate my curiosity.

### **Beyond the Code**
When I am not fine-tuning LLMs, I am usually:
* ⛰️ **Hiking** the Sahyadris and Himalayas to find silence.
* 📖 **Reading** fiction to understand people.
* ✍️ **Writing** poetry to untangle my thoughts.
